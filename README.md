Req is a batteries-included HTTP client for Elixir.

With just a couple lines of code:

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:req, "~> 0.5.0"}
])

Req.get!("https://api.github.com/repos/wojtekmach/req").body["description"]
#=> "Req is a batteries-included HTTP client for Elixir."
```

we get automatic response body decompression & decoding, following redirects, retrying on errors,
and much more. Virtually all of the features are broken down into individual functions called
_steps_. You can easily re-use and re-arrange built-in steps (see [`Req.Steps`] module) and
write new ones.

## Features

  * An easy to use high-level API: [`Req.request/1`], [`Req.new/1`], [`Req.get!/2`], [`Req.post!/2`], etc.

  * Extensibility via request, response, and error steps.

  * Request body compression (via [`compress_body`] step)

  * Automatic response body decompression (via [`compressed`] and [`decompress_body`] steps). Supports gzip, brotli, and zstd.

  * Request body encoding. Supports urlencoded and multipart forms, and JSON. See [`encode_body`].

  * Automatic response body decoding (via [`decode_body`] step.)

  * Encode params as query string (via [`put_params`] step.)

  * Setting base URL (via [`put_base_url`] step.)

  * Templated request paths (via [`put_path_params`] step.)

  * Basic, bearer, and `.netrc` authentication (via [`auth`] step.)

  * Range requests (via [`put_range`]) step.)

  * Use AWS V4 Signature (via [`put_aws_sigv4`]) step.)

  * Request body streaming (by setting `body: enumerable`.)

  * Response body streaming (by setting `into: fun | collectable | :self`.)

  * Follows redirects (via [`redirect`] step.)

  * Retries on errors (via [`retry`] step.)

  * Raise on 4xx/5xx errors (via [`handle_http_errors`] step.)

  * Verify response body against a checksum (via [`checksum`] step.)

  * Basic HTTP caching (via [`cache`] step.)

  * Easily create test stubs (see [`Req.Test`].)

  * Running against a plug (via [`run_plug`] step.)

  * Pluggable adapters. By default, Req uses [Finch] (via [`run_finch`] step.)

## Usage

The easiest way to use Req is with [`Mix.install/2`] (requires Elixir v1.12+):

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:req, "~> 0.5.0"}
])

Req.get!("https://api.github.com/repos/wojtekmach/req").body["description"]
#=> "Req is a batteries-included HTTP client for Elixir."
```

If you want to use Req in a Mix project, you can add the above dependency to your `mix.exs`.

Here's an example POST with JSON data:

```elixir
iex> Req.post!("https://httpbin.org/post", json: %{x: 1, y: 2}).body["json"]
%{"x" => 1, "y" => 2}
```

You can stream request body:

```elixir
iex> stream = Stream.duplicate("foo", 3)
iex> Req.post!("https://httpbin.org/post", body: stream).body["data"]
"foofoofoo"
```

and stream the response body:

```elixir
iex> resp = Req.get!("http://httpbin.org/stream/2", into: IO.stream())
# output: {"url": "http://httpbin.org/stream/2", ...}
# output: {"url": "http://httpbin.org/stream/2", ...}
iex> resp.status
200
iex> resp.body
%IO.Stream{}
```

(See [`Req`] module documentation for more examples of response body streaming.)

If you are planning to make several similar requests, you can build up a request struct with
desired common options and re-use it:

```elixir
req = Req.new(base_url: "https://api.github.com")

Req.get!(req, url: "/repos/sneako/finch").body["description"]
#=> "Elixir HTTP client, focused on performance"

Req.get!(req, url: "/repos/elixir-mint/mint").body["description"]
#=> "Functional HTTP client for Elixir with support for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2."
```

See [`Req.new/1`] for more information on available options.

Virtually all of Req's features are broken down into individual pieces - steps. Req works by running
the request struct through these steps. You can easily reuse or rearrange built-in steps or write new
ones. Importantly, steps are just regular functions. Here is another example where we append a request
step that inspects the URL just before requesting it:

```elixir
req =
  Req.new(base_url: "https://api.github.com")
  |> Req.Request.append_request_steps(
    debug_url: fn request ->
      IO.inspect(URI.to_string(request.url))
      request
    end
  )

Req.get!(req, url: "/repos/wojtekmach/req").body["description"]
# output: "https://api.github.com/repos/wojtekmach/req"
#=> "Req is a batteries-included HTTP client for Elixir."
```

Custom steps can be packaged into plugins so that they are even easier to use by others.
Here are some examples:

  * [`req_easyhtml`]
  * [`req_s3`]
  * [`req_hex`]
  * [`req_github_oauth`]

And here is how they can be used:

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:req, "~> 0.5.0"},
  {:req_easyhtml, "~> 0.1.0"},
  {:req_s3, "~> 0.2.3"},
  {:req_hex, "~> 0.2.0"},
  {:req_github_oauth, "~> 0.1.0"}
])

req =
  (Req.new(http_errors: :raise)
  |> ReqEasyHTML.attach()
  |> ReqS3.attach()
  |> ReqHex.attach()
  |> ReqGitHubOAuth.attach())

Req.get!(req, url: "https://elixir-lang.org").body[".entry-summary h5"]
#=>
# #EasyHTML[<h5>
#    Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.
#  </h5>]

Req.get!(req, url: "s3://ossci-datasets/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz").body
#=> <<0, 0, 8, 3, ...>>

Req.get!(req, url: "https://repo.hex.pm/tarballs/req-0.1.0.tar").body["metadata.config"]["links"]
#=> %{"GitHub" => "https://github.com/wojtekmach/req"}

Req.get!(req, url: "https://api.github.com/user").body["login"]
# output:
# paste this user code:
#
#   6C44-30A8
#
# at:
#
#   https://github.com/login/device
#
# open browser window? [Yn]
# 15:22:28.350 [info] response: authorization_pending
# 15:22:33.519 [info] response: authorization_pending
# 15:22:38.678 [info] response: authorization_pending
#=> "wojtekmach"

Req.get!(req, url: "https://api.github.com/user").body["login"]
#=> "wojtekmach"
```

See [`Req.Request`] module documentation for more information on low-level API, request struct, and developing plugins.
