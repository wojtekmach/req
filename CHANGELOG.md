# CHANGELOG

## HEAD

  * Fix typespecs for some functions

  * [`decompress_body`]: Remove support for `deflate` compression

  * [`decompress_body`]: Don't crash on unknown codec

  * [`decompress_body`]: Fix handling HEAD requests

  * [`run_finch`]: Add `:inet6` option

  * [`retry`]: Support `retry: :safe_transient` which retries HTTP 408/429/500/502/503/504
    or exceptions with :reason set to :timeout/:econnrefused.

    `:safe_transient` is the new default retry mode. (Previously we retried on 408/429/5xx and
    _any_ exception.)

  * [`retry`]: Support `retry: :transient` which is the same as `:safe_transient` except
    it retries on all HTTP methods

  * [`retry`]: Deprecate `retry: :safe` in favour of `retry: :safe_transient`

  * [`retry`]: Deprecate `retry: :never` in favour of `retry: false`

  * [`Req.request/2`]: Improve error message on invalid arguments

  * [`Req.update/2`]: Do not duplicate headers

  * [`Req.update/2`]: Merge `:params`

  * [`Req.Request`]: Fix displaying redacted basic authentication

  * Make `request.registered_options` internal representation private.

  * Make `request.options` internal representation private.

    Currently `request.options` field is a map but it may change in the future.
    One possible future change is using keywords lists internally which would
    allow, for example, `Req.new(params: [a: 1]) |> Req.update(params: [b: 2])`
    to keep duplicate `:params` in `request.options` which would then allow to
    decide the duplicate key semantics on a per-step basis. And so, for example,
    [`put_params`] would _merge_ params but most steps would simply use the
    first value.

    To have some room for manoeuvre in the future we should stop pattern
    matching on `request.options`. Calling `request.options[key]`,
    `put_in(request.options[key], value)`, and
    `update_in(request.options[key], fun)` _is_ allowed.
    New functions [`Req.Request.get_option/3`] and
    [`Req.Request.delete_option/1`] have been added for additional ways to
    manipulate the internal representation.

## v0.3.11 (2023-07-24)

## v0.3.0 (2022-06-21)

Req v0.3.0 brings redesigned API, new steps, and improvements to existing steps.

### New API

The new API allows building a request struct with all the built-in steps. It can be then piped
to functions like `Req.get!/2`:

```elixir
iex> req = Req.new(base_url: "https://api.github.com")

iex> req |> Req.get!(url: "/repos/sneako/finch") |> then(& &1.body["description"])
"Elixir HTTP client, focused on performance"

iex> req |> Req.get(url: "/repos/elixir-mint/mint") |> then(& &1.body["description"])
"Functional HTTP client for Elixir with support for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2."
```

Setting body and encoding it to form/JSON is now done through `:body/:form/:json` options:

```elixir
iex> Req.post!("https://httpbin.org/anything", body: "hello!").body["data"]
"hello!"

iex> req = Req.new(url: "https://httpbin.org/anything")
iex> Req.post!(req, form: [x: 1]).body["form"]
%{"x" => "1"}
iex> Req.post!(req, json: %{x: 2}).body["form"]
%{"x" => 2}
```

### Improved Error Handling

Req now validates option names ensuring users didn't accidentally mistyped them.
If they did, it will try to give a helpful error message. Here are some examples:

```elixir
Req.request!(urll: "https://httpbin.org")
** (ArgumentError) unknown option :urll. Did you mean :url?

Req.new(bas_url: "https://httpbin.org")
** (ArgumentError) unknown option :bas_url. Did you mean :base_url?
```

Req also has a new option to handle HTTP errors (4xx/5xx). By default it will continue to
return the error responses:

```elixir
Req.get!("https://httpbin.org/status/404")
#=> %Req.Response{status: 404, ...}
```

but users can now pass `http_errors: :raise` to raise an exception instead:

```elixir
Req.get!("https://httpbin.org/status/404", http_errors: :raise)
** (RuntimeError) The requested URL returned error: 404
Response body: ""
```

This is especially useful in one-off scripts where we only really care about the
"happy path" but would still like to get a good error message when something
unexpected happened.

### Plugins

From the very beginning, Req could be extended with custom steps. To make using such custom steps
by others even easier, they can be packaged up into plugins.

Here are some examples:

  * [`req_easyhtml`](https://github.com/wojtekmach/req_easyhtml)
  * [`req_s3`](https://github.com/wojtekmach/req_s3)
  * [`req_hex`](https://github.com/wojtekmach/req_hex)
  * [`req_github_oauth`](https://github.com/wojtekmach/req_github_oauth)

And here's how they can be used:

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:req, "~> 0.3.0"},
  {:req_easyhtml, github: "wojtekmach/req_easyhtml"},
  {:req_s3, github: "wojtekmach/req_s3"},
  {:req_hex, github: "wojtekmach/req_hex"},
  {:req_github_oauth, github: "wojtekmach/req_github_oauth"}
])

req =
  (Req.new(http_errors: :raise)
  |> ReqEasyHTML.attach()
  |> ReqS3.attach()
  |> ReqHex.attach()
  |> ReqGitHubOAuth.attach())

Req.get!(req, url: "https://elixir-lang.org").body[".entry-summary h5"]
#=>
# #EasyHTML[<h5>
#    Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.
#  </h5>]

Req.get!(req, url: "s3://ossci-datasets").body
#=>
# [
#   "mnist/",
#   "mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz",
#   "mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz",
#   "mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz",
#   "mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz"
# ]

Req.get!(req, url: "https://repo.hex.pm/tarballs/req-0.1.0.tar").body["metadata.config"]["links"]
#=> %{"GitHub" => "https://github.com/wojtekmach/req"}

Req.get!(req, url: "https://api.github.com/user").body["login"]
# Outputs:
# paste this user code:
#
#   6C44-30A8
#
# at:
#
#   https://github.com/login/device
#
# open browser window? [Yn]
# 15:22:28.350 [info] response: authorization_pending
# 15:22:33.519 [info] response: authorization_pending
# 15:22:38.678 [info] response: authorization_pending
#=> "wojtekmach"

Req.get!(req, url: "https://api.github.com/user").body["login"]
#=> "wojtekmach"
```

Notice all plugins can be attached to the same request struct which makes it really easy to
explore different endpoints.

See ["Writing Plugins" section in `Req.Request` module documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-writing-plugins)
for more information.

### Plug Integration

Req can now be used to easily test plugs using the `:plug` option:

```elixir
defmodule Echo do
  def call(conn, _) do
    "/" <> path = conn.request_path
    Plug.Conn.send_resp(conn, 200, path)
  end
end

test "echo" do
  assert Req.get!("http:///hello", plug: Echo).body == "hello"
end
```

you can define plugs as functions too:

```elixir
test "echo" do
  echo = fn conn ->
    "/" <> path = conn.request_path
    Plug.Conn.send_resp(conn, 200, path)
  end

  assert Req.get!("http:///hello", plug: echo).body == "hello"
end
```

which is particularly useful to create HTTP service mocks with tools like
[Bypass](https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/bypass).

### Request Adapters

While Req always used Finch as the underlying HTTP client, it was designed from the day one to
easily swap it out. This is now even easier with an `:adapter` option.

Here is a mock adapter that always returns a successful response:

```elixir
adapter = fn request ->
  response = %Req.Response{status: 200, body: "it works!"}
  {request, response}
end

Req.request!(url: "http://example", adapter: adapter).body
#=> "it works!"
```

Here is another one that uses the [`json/2`][resp_json] function to conveniently
return a JSON response:

[resp_json]: https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Response.html#json/2

```elixir
adapter = fn request ->
  response = Req.Response.json(%{hello: 42})
  {request, response}
end

resp = Req.request!(url: "http://example", adapter: adapter)
resp.headers
#=> [{"content-type", "application/json"}]
resp.body
#=> %{"hello" => 42}
```

And here is a naive Hackney-based adapter and how we can use it:

```elixir
hackney = fn request ->
  case :hackney.request(
         request.method,
         URI.to_string(request.url),
         request.headers,
         request.body,
         [:with_body]
       ) do
    {:ok, status, headers, body} ->
      headers = for {name, value} <- headers, do: {String.downcase(name), value}
      response = %Req.Response{status: status, headers: headers, body: body}
      {request, response}

    {:error, reason} ->
      {request, RuntimeError.exception(inspect(reason))}
  end
end

Req.get!("https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-lang/elixir", adapter: hackney).body["description"]
#=> "Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications"
```

See "Adapter" section in `Req.Request` module documentation for more information.

### Major changes

  * Add high-level functional API: `Req.new(...) |> Req.request(...)`, `Req.new(...) |>
    Req.get!(...)`, etc.

  * Add `Req.Request.options` field that steps can read from. Also, make
    all steps be arity 1.

    When using "High-level" API, we now run all steps by default. (The
    steps, by looking at request.options, can decide to be no-op.)

  * Move low-level API to `Req.Request`

  * Move built-in steps to `Req.Steps`

  * Add step names

  * Add `Req.head!/2`

  * Add `Req.patch!/2`

  * Add `Req.Request.adapter` field

  * Add `Req.Request.merge_options/2`

  * Add `Req.Request.register_options/2`

  * Add `Req.Request.put_header/3`

  * Add `Req.Request.put_headers/2`

  * Add `Req.Request.put_new_header/3`

  * Add `Req.Request.get_header/2`

  * Add `Req.Request.update_private/4`

  * Add `Req.Response.new/1`

  * Add `Req.Response.json/2`

  * Add `Req.Response.get_header/2`

  * Add `Req.Response.put_header/3`

  * Rename `put_if_modified_since` step to `cache`

  * Rename `decompress` step to `decompress_body`

  * Remove `put_default_steps` step

  * Remove `run_steps` step

  * Remove `put_default_headers` step

  * Remove `encode_headers` step. The headers are now encoded in `Req.new/1` and `Req.request/2`

  * Remove `Req.Request.unix_socket` field. Add option on `run_finch` step with the same name
    instead.

  * Require Elixir 1.12

### Step changes

  * New step: [`put_user_agent`] (replaces part of removed `put_default_headers`)

  * New step: [`compressed`] (replaces part of removed `put_default_headers`)

  * New step: [`compress_body`]

  * New step: [`output`]

  * New step: [`handle_http_errors`]

  * [`put_base_url`]: Ignore base URL if given URL contains scheme

  * [`run_finch`]: Add `:connect_options` which dynamically starts (or re-uses already started)
    Finch pool with the given connection options.

  * [`run_finch`]: Replace `:finch_options` with `:receive_timeout` and `:pool_timeout` options

  * [`encode_body`]: Add `:form` and `:json` options (previously used as `{:form, data}` and
    `{:json, data}`)

  * [`follow_redirects`]: Change method to GET on 301..303 redirects

  * [`follow_redirects`]: Don't send auth headers on redirect to different scheme/host/port
    unless `location_trusted: true` is set

  * [`retry`]: The `Retry-After` response header on HTTP 429 responses is now respected

  * [`retry`]: The `:retry` option can now be set to `:safe` (default) to only retry GET/HEAD
    requests on HTTP 408/429/5xx responses or exceptions, `:always` to always retry, `:never` to never
    retry, and `fun` - a 1-arity function that accepts either a `Req.Response` or an exception
    struct and returns boolean whether to retry

  * [`retry`]: The `:retry_delay` option now accepts a function that takes a retry count (starting at 0)
    and returns the delay. Defaults to a simple exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ...

### Deprecations

  * Deprecate calling `Req.post!(url, body)` in favour of `Req.post!(url, body: body)`.
    Also, deprecate `Req.post!(url, {:form, data})` in favour of `Req.post!(url, form: data)`.
    and `Req.post!(url, {:json, data})` in favour of `Req.post!(url, json: data)`. Same for
    `Req.put!/2`.

  * Deprecate setting `retry: [delay: delay, max_retries: max_retries]`
    in favour of `retry_delay: delay, max_retries: max_retries`.

  * Deprecate setting `cache: [dir: dir]` in favour of `cache_dir: dir`.

  * Deprecate Req.build/3 in favour of manually building the struct.
