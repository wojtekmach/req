  Req already has built-in support for stubs via `:plug`, `:adapter`, and (indirectly) `:base_url`
  options. This module enhances these capabilities by providing:

    * Stub any value with [`Req.Test.stub(name, value)`](`stub/2`) and access it with
      [`Req.Test.stub(name)`](`stub/1`). These functions can be used in concurrent tests.

    * Access plug stubs with `plug: {Req.Test, name}`.

    * Easily create JSON responses for Plug stubs with [`Req.Test.json(conn, body)`](`json/2`).

  This module bases stubs on the ownership model of
  [nimble_ownership](https://hex.pm/packages/nimble_ownership), also used by
  [Mox](https://hex.pm/packages/mox) for example. This allows `Req.Test` to be used in concurrent
  tests.

  ## Example

  Imagine we're building an app that displays weather for a given location using an HTTP weather
  service:

      defmodule MyApp.Weather do
        def get_rating(location) do
          case get_temperature(location) do
            {:ok, %{status: 200, body: %{"celsius" => celsius}}} ->
              cond do
                celsius < 18.0 -> {:ok, :too_cold}
                celsius < 30.0 -> {:ok, :nice}
                true -> {:ok, :too_hot}
              end

            _ ->
              :error
          end
        end

        def get_temperature(location) do
          [
            base_url: "https://weather-service"
          ]
          |> Keyword.merge(Application.get_env(:myapp, :weather_req_options, []))
          |> Req.request()
        end
      end

  We configure it for production:

      # config/runtime.exs
      config :myapp, weather_req_options: [
        auth: {:bearer, System.fetch_env!("MYAPP_WEATHER_API_KEY")}
      ]

  In tests, instead of hitting the network, we make the request against
  a [plug](`Req.Steps.put_plug/1`) _stub_ named `MyApp.Weather`:

      # config/test.exs
      config :myapp, weather_req_options: [
        plug: {Req.Test, MyApp.Weather}
      ]

  Now we can control our stubs **in concurrent tests**:

      use ExUnit.Case, async: true

      test "nice weather" do
        Req.Test.stub(MyApp.Weather, fn conn ->
          Req.Test.json(conn, %{"celsius" => 25.0})
        end)

        assert MyApp.Weather.get_rating("Krakow, Poland") == {:ok, :nice}
      end

  ### Concurrency and Allowances

  The example above works in concurrent tests because `MyApp.Weather.get_rating/1` calls
  directly to `Req.request/1` *in the same process*. It also works in many cases where the
  request happens in a spawned process, such as a `Task`, `GenServer`, and more.

  However, if you are encountering issues with stubs not being available in spawned processes,
  it's likely that you'll need **explicit allowances**. For example, if
  `MyApp.Weather.get_rating/1` was calling `Req.request/1` in a process spawned with `spawn/1`,
  the stub would not be available in the spawned process:

      # With code like this, the stub would not be available in the spawned task:
      def get_rating_async(location) do
        spawn(fn -> get_rating(location) end)
      end

  To make stubs defined in the test process available in other processes, you can use
  `allow/3`. For example, imagine that the call to `MyApp.Weather.get_rating/1`
  was happening in a spawned GenServer:

      test "nice weather" do
        {:ok, pid} = start_gen_server(...)

        Req.Test.stub(MyApp.Weather, fn conn ->
          Req.Test.json(conn, %{"celsius" => 25.0})
        end)

        Req.Test.allow(MyApp.Weather, self(), pid)

        assert get_weather(pid, "Krakow, Poland") == {:ok, :nice}
      end
